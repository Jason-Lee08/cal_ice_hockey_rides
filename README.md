# Carpool Route Builder

This tool reads your Rides Sheet in Google Sheets, builds carpool groups, looks up home addresses from Full Address & Contact Info, computes traffic-aware pickup routes (outbound + return) to a final destination, writes blue, clickable Google Maps links back into the sheet (driver cell for Go, adjacent cell for Return), and saves a JSON summary.

### 1) Install & Use uv (virtualenv + deps)

Weâ€™ll use `uv` to create a local `.venv` and install dependencies from your `pyproject.toml`.

Basically, run the following commands in your terminal.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

uv venv

source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install -e .
```

**Windows** (note: this is untested)

```shell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex

uv venv

. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

uv pip install -e .
```

Basically, this does the following:
1. Installs UV
2. Creates a virtual environment called `.venv`
3. Activates the virtual environment (so when you use `python` it's using the python installed in `.venv`)
4. Installs the python libraries/dependencies for this project

#### Credentials

To run this project, you need Sheets access (service account) and Maps traffic (API key). 

To get this, I'll just share a file called `calicehockey-map-d5de75ad4b3d.json` with you. This gives you access to the service account I'm using which is how you read/edit the spreadsheet. I'll also give you a `.env` file that has a `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` which is what is used to get the live traffic data.
